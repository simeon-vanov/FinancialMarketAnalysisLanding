# Understanding Price Charts

Price charts are fundamental tools in technical analysis, providing a visual representation of an asset's price movement over time. Learning to read and interpret these charts is essential for making informed trading decisions. This post will cover the basic types of price charts and the importance of different time frames in trading, with a focus on the time frames supported by our platform: 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, and 1 week.

## Types of Price Charts

#### Line Charts

Line charts are the simplest form of price charts, plotting a line from one closing price to the next. While they provide a clear view of the overall trend, they lack detailed information about price movements within each time period.

#### Bar Charts

Bar charts offer more information than line charts. Each bar represents a specific time period and displays the opening, high, low, and closing prices (OHLC). The top of the bar indicates the highest price reached, the bottom shows the lowest price, and the left and right horizontal lines represent the opening and closing prices, respectively.

#### Candlestick Charts

Candlestick charts are the most popular among traders due to their detailed and visually intuitive format. Like bar charts, they show the OHLC prices for each time period. The body of the candlestick represents the range between the opening and closing prices, while the wicks (or shadows) show the high and low prices. Candlesticks are color-coded to indicate whether the price moved up or down during the period, making it easier to interpret market sentiment at a glance.

## Importance of Time Frames

Time frames play a crucial role in technical analysis, as they determine the scope of the price data you are analyzing. Different trading methodologies rely on various time frames to make decisions. Our platform supports 1-hour, 4-hour, 1-day, and 1-week time frames, which are particularly suited for swing trading but can also be used for other trading styles.

#### 1-Hour Time Frame

#### 1-Day Time Frame

#### 1-Week Time Frame
