### Advertising
We display advertising on the Website and may use remarketing and tracking features. Remarketing features allow us to display advertising in a more targeted manner to present advertisements of interest to users.

This data helps us evaluate the performance of ad campaigns. Note that we collect pseudonymous data only.

## Public Information on Our Site

## Security of Personal Data
We use technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal data and require third parties with whom we work to do the same.

We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology to protect certain information that you submit to us. This technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone while it is being transmitted to DecodeTheTrade or payment processor. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the "lock" icon in the browser window is displayed, confirming that a secure and encrypted connection has been established with the Website.

We work hard to ensure that our Service is secure and that we meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards, such as firewalls, authentication systems (i.e. passwords and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data. If you have chosen to create an account, you are responsible for doing everything you reasonably can to keep your access details secret. You must not share these details with anyone else.

We also do our best to protect user information offline. All of our users' personal information is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need to see the information to perform their jobs are allowed to access it. The servers that store personal data are located in a secure environment in a locked facility.

We are constantly improving the ways we secure, store, and process the data we collect, including the addition of physical security measures that help us counter unauthorized access to our systems. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children and Sensitive Personal Data
This Website is not directed towards children who are under the age of 18. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children below the age of 18 years or sensitive personal data. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately so that we can either obtain special consent or delete the information.

## Third-Party Sites

### Links to Other Sites
At our discretion, we may add links to other websites from our Website. These websites can be run by third parties with separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility nor are we liable for any content, activities, or privacy policies of these linked sites. We suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit.

### Our Hosted Charting Solutions
Some business partners use our charting solutions on their own websites. Such sites may display messages such as "Powered by DecodeTheTrade" or similar. We do not control the privacy policies of these sites, regardless of whether or not these messages are displayed. Again, we suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit.

## EEA and UK Users' Specific Rights
Individuals subject to European and United Kingdom ("UK") data protection laws may have data subject rights in relation to the personal data we hold on them (described in detail below). This may, in and of itself, be subject to limitations and/or restrictions.

If you are located in the EEA or UK, please contact us to exercise your rights.

### Accessing Data
If prompted, we will confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data and if so, we will provide you with a copy of that personal data along with any other pertinent details. If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee, but this can be discussed and depends on the situation.

### Restricting the Processing of Personal Data
You may ask us to restrict or ‘block’ the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it. We will notify you before we lift any restriction on processing. If we share your personal data with others, we will notify them of the restriction wherever possible. If prompted, and if it is possible and lawful to do so, we will also notify you with whom we have shared or will share your personal data so you can contact them directly.

### Objections
You may:
- Ask us to stop processing your personal data at any time, and we will do so. If we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your personal data, then it should not be a problem unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing;
- Object to our processing of your data for the purposes of direct marketing at any time. This can be done by clicking the "unsubscribe" button in our marketing emails; and
- Refuse to receive service notifications via email. This can be adjusted in the User Settings.

### Withdrawal of Consent
If we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness with which we process your data before receiving notice of your wish to withdraw your consent. We emphasize that we do not generally rely on your consent to allow us to process your personal data if there is another lawful ground available. If we do rely on your consent, we will make this clear to you at that time.

### Viewing and Correcting Data
You have the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified or completed if it is incomplete. In order to do so, each user can view, manage, and/or update his/her personal data in the Profile Settings.

If we share your personal data with others, we will notify them of any corrections made whenever possible. If prompted, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also notify you with whom we have shared your personal data so you can contact them directly if need be.

### Deleting Data
You have the right to refuse to use our Services and may ask us to delete or remove your personal data in certain circumstances. If we share your data with others, we will notify them of the edits wherever possible. If prompted, and wherever possible and lawful to do so, we will also notify you with whom we have shared your personal data so you can contact them directly if need be.

Please see the "User Account Deletion" section for more details.

### Data Retention
We will keep your personal data (1) until you decide to delete your account (upon request), or (2) as required by law or as necessary for legitimate business purposes (i.e. for tax, legal, accounting, fraud, or abuse prevention, and/or other purposes). This data can be stored even after an account is deleted.

Upon expiration of the applicable retention period, we will securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you. In this case, such data is no longer considered personal.

If you consent to receive marketing communications, we will keep your data until you unsubscribe, which is possible via the ‘unsubscribe’ button at the end of our marketing emails. Additional methods to unsubscribe may be added in the future.

### Data Portability
You have the right to obtain your personal data from us, which you consented to give us or that was provided to us as necessary in connection with our contract with you. We will give you your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You may reuse it elsewhere if you so wish.

### Lodge a Complaint with the Data Protection Authority
If you have concerns about our privacy practices, including the way we handle or have your personal data, you can report it to any competent data protection authority of a European Union member state that is authorized to hear such concerns (you may find European Union Data Protection Authorities’ contact information here) or to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us. Note that we may need to ask you for further information to verify your identity before we can respond to any request.

## International Data Transfers
DecodeTheTrade Inc. is based in the United States and United Kingdom. The information collected through Services will be stored on servers located in the United States, European Union, and other destinations (including outside the EEA), to our service providers and affiliated businesses for the purposes described above. This is necessary to enable you to navigate and use our Services. The data may be transmitted to our service providers and affiliates supporting our business operations (described above).

Note that the countries concerned may not provide the same legal standards for protection of your personal data that you have in the EEA. If we transfer your personal data to countries outside of your country, we will take the necessary steps to ensure your information receives an adequate level of security protection where it is processed and that your rights continue to be protected.

If you would like to receive more information on the safeguards that we implement, please contact us.
